# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
# Add logic to print two lines.
# The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b
# The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b


a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a // b)
print(a / b)
